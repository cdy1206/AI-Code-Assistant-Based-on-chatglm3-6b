# AI-Code-Assistant-Based-on-chatglm3-6b


## Project description:
This project aims to develop an intelligent programming assistant based on deep learning that can automatically generate corresponding Python code based on natural language instructions input by the user and perform data visualization tasks. The system integrates the latest natural language processing model and supports a variety of data visualization needs, such as generating histograms, pie charts, etc., while providing real-time visual display of movie box office, air quality and other data.

## technical challenge:
How to accurately understand and convert complex natural language queries into valid Python code.
Ensure generated code is robust and execution-safe under various data inputs.
Achieve efficient data processing and graphics generation, and optimize user interaction experience.

## solution:
Utilize the pre-trained deep learning model chatglm3-6b to process and generate code.
A multiple-try mechanism is designed to review and correct generated Python code through regular expressions and compilation checks.
Able to automatically use libraries such as matplotlib and pandas to process data, generate charts, and save charts.
A front-end interface based on Gradio was built to allow users to intuitively enter queries and view charts and data results.

## result:
Successfully developed a full-featured programming assistant that enables users to complete complex programming and data visualization tasks through simple natural language input.
In actual use, the project can quickly respond to user needs, generate charts and codes with high accuracy, and improve user satisfaction.
The implementation of the project improves the efficiency of data analysis and display, and provides non-technical users with powerful data processing tools.
Such a description not only shows the entire project in detail, but also reflects your technical capabilities and problem-solving methods in the project.
